Set up instructions for all linear gaussian experiments, this only needs to be performed once to run both experiments.
If using the file structure as obtained from cloning our github repo, only step 2 is required.

1. Ensure that there is a directory containing all the following files:
    lg_setup.py
    lg_model.py
    "Comparison with the Kalman filter.ipynb"
    "Learning proposal parameters.ipynb"

2. Run the command "python -m lg_setup.py".
    This command takes the optional command line options --dx, --dy and --batch_size.
    The parameters --dx, --dy are the dimensions of the state and observations respectively. Defaults dx = 25, dy = 1 are as in the paper.
    --batch_size determines the batch_size to use when generating simulated trajectories.
