Set up instructions for all stochastic volatility experiments, this only needs to be performed once to run all three experiments.
If using the file structure as obtained from cloning our github repo, only step 2 is required.

1. Ensure that there is a directory containing all the following files:
    sv_setup.py
    sv_model.py
    sv_training_loop.py
    "Unsupervised learning of multiple parameters.ipynb"
    "Performing filtering given a fully specified model.ipynb"
    "Unsupervised learning of a single parameter.ipynb"

2. Run the command "python -m sv_setup.py".
    This command takes the optional command line options --alpha, --beta, --sigma and --batch_size.
    The parameters --alpha, --beta and --sigma set the true parameters for the simulated data used in the "Performing filtering given a fully specified model" experiment, defaults are as in the paper.
    --batch_size determines the batch_size to use when generating simulated trajectories.

3. The "Unsupervised learning of a single parameter" experiment, additionally requires the that the datafile "test_trajectory.csv" found in our github (https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf/tree/main) be downloaded and placed
    /data/ directory created by sv_setup.py.
